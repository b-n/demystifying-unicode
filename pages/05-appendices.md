## A world before encoding/before the web?

Be grug developer:

- I use IBM 437 because I'm writing DOS applications
- Everyone else must use IBM 437, because they all speak english and like borders right?
- Write once, run only on my machine

Hypothesis: When the world started going online...

Dos world: IBM437

Windows world: ISO-8859-1

**ðŸŒ¶ Facts**: HTTP 1.1 used to use `ISO-8859-1` as the default charset ðŸ¤¯

## Important

UTF-[8/16/32] __should__ always be the same everywhere

UTF-8 == UTF-8

UTF-16 == UTF-16

UTF-32 == UTF-32

<!--
The encoding standard is the encoding standard. If people are implementing UTF-8 in different ways (e.g. reverse byte order), then they are not using UTF-8, they have their own special thing.

## Composition

`\u003d\u0338\u003d` vs. `\u2260` vs. `!=`

```
'=Ì¸=' != 'â‰ ' != '!='
```

Not not equal

## Digraphs/ligatures

Digraphs and ligatures are both made by combining two glyphs:

- In a digraph, the glyphs remain separate but are placed close together.
- In a ligature, the glyphs are fused into a single glyph.

Generally speaking, Unicode doesn't like dealing with this problem.

> The Unicode Standard is a character encoding standard, and is **not intended to standardize ligatures or other presentation forms**, or any other aspects of the details of font and glyph design. The ligatures which you can find in the Unicode Standard are **compatibility encodings** onlyâ€”and are not meant to set a precedent requiring the encoding of all ligatures as characters.

TL;DR; you shouldn't expect any ligatures/digraphs to be added to Unicode any time soon.

## Flags

- Who adds a new flag?
- Flag sequences
  - :RGI_Emoji_Flag_Sequence
  - https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/#Flags
  - Qatar flag = wideboi

- "ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡±ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡´ðŸ‡¼ðŸ‡´ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡©" ??

Flag types:
- country/region
- local (gbeng, etc)

## Conventionally UTF-8 vs. Guaranteed

Sometimes you just want cats:

```rust
use bstr::ByteSlice;

fn main() {
    let raw: &[u8] =
        b"\x80\x90\xF0\x9F\x99\x84Pl\xF0\x9F\x98\xBBain\xF0\x9F\x98\xBEText!\x80\x80\x80";

    let cats: String = raw
        .chars()
        .filter(|c| ('\u{1F638}'..'\u{1F640}').contains(c))
        .collect();

    println!("Cats: {}", cats);
    // Cats: ðŸ˜»ðŸ˜¾
}
```
