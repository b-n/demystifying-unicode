# History

## A bit (🥁鈸) of fundamentals

<div class="mt-5">

> Computers represent information as 1's and 0's
> - Literally everyone, since forever

</div>

Multiple bits can be put together to make different structures.

- 8 bits makes a byte
- 4/8 bytes makes a word on 32/64 bit architectures respectively

👆 Although unimportant for this talk, these things are the main language of a computer, bits, bytes, words. Compilers compile our code, so we can make more __human__ structures. Often the compilers optimise our code for thigns the computer understands.

## Abstraction

<div class="mt-5">

</div>

`C` originally abstracted things a little further:

<v-clicks>

- `bool` is a 1 bit
- `char` is a 8 bits
- `int` is ambiguous, we gained:
  - `uint8_t`, `uint32_t`, `int8_t`
  - ... etc, etc.
- `long` also ambiguous, but >= `int`

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

But - what really __is__ a `char`?

And what really are characters?

## Abstract? ABSTRACT!

Quiz time - what does this say:

```
01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000
01010111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100 00100001
```

<v-click>

`00100000` = `0x20` = ` `
<span class="pl-15">
`00100001` = `0x21` = `!`
</span>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<hr />

```
0100 1000  =  0x48  =  'H'
0110 0101  =  0x65  =  'e'
0110 1100  =  0x6c  =  'l'
0110 1100  =  0x6c  =  'l'
0110 1111  =  0x6f  =  'o'
0010 0000  =  0x20  =  ' '
0101 0111  =  0x57  =  'W'
0110 1111  =  0x6f  =  'o'
0111 0010  =  0x72  =  'r'
0110 1100  =  0x6c  =  'l'
0110 0100  =  0x64  =  'd'
0010 0001  =  0x21  =  '!'

## Summary:

<v-clicks>

- The term charactor is ambiguous.
- `char` isn't a character, it's just a `uint8_t` with a fancy name
- ASCII is "characters" `0x00..0x7F` - **7 BITS**
- We need a whole lot more bits if we want more than just English
