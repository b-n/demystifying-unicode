## Why Unicode?

<v-clicks>

1. Codepages/charmaps? System dependant
1. Unique characters? Duplication everywhere
1. Display more than one codepage/charmap at a time? ‚êé‚êè‚êé‚êè‚êé‚êè‚êé‚êè
1. Text from outside of Europe? :ha:

## Unicode to the resque

<v-click>

- Universal
- Efficient
- Unambiguous

</v-click>

<!--
- Universal: Encompass all characters that can be used in general text interchange
- Efficient: Simple to store and parse. Fixed character codes for all the charaters, no switch code pages/charmaps.
- Unambiguous: `\1F600` is a grinning face - everywhere.

Ref: https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/ch01.pdf

> The Unicode Standard was designed to be:
>
> - Universal. The repertoire must be large enough to encompass all characters that are likely to be used in general text interchange, including those in major international, national, and industry character sets.
> - Efficient. Plain text is simple to parse: software does not have to maintain state or look for special escape sequences, and character synchronization from any point in a character stream is quick and unambiguous. A fixed character code allows for efficient sorting, searching, display, and editing of text.
> - Unambiguous. Any given Unicode code point always represents the same character

## New Terminology

| | | |
| - | - | - |
| Glyph | ‚ÄΩ | How it actually looks, defined by the font |
| Codepoint | U+203D | Unique identifier for this character |
| Character | Interrobang | Description of the codepoint | 
| Block | General Punctuation, U+2000 - U+206F | The range of codepoints for a specific purpose |
| Plane | Basic Multilingual Plane, U+0000 - U+FFFF | The wide group of codepoints |

<!--
Glyphs are what are drawn to the screen, generally unicode interpreted by a font for example
Character is still ambiguous, but in unicode it's the description of the codepoint

## Encoding

<v-clicks>

**DIN 91379**: 925 characters

At least 10 bits - (Names/Data exchange in Europe)

Unicode:
- Supports 1048576 Characters
- Code space: U+000000 - U+10FFFF
- Which requires at least 21 bits

</v-clicks>

<footer>

Fun fact: Unicode <2.0 code space was 16-bit wide.

## Nuts and bolts of UTF-8

Key points:

- Variable width (1-4 bytes)
- ‚à¥ Variable offset between characters
- The default in Rust (+many more)

<v-click>

<hr />

| Code point range | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | Bit Capacity | Code points |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| `0x000000..0x00007F` | `0xxxxxxx` | | | | 7 | 128 |
| `0x000080..0x0007FF` | `110xxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | | | 11 | 1920 |
| `0x000800..0x00FFFF` | `1110xxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | | 16 | 63488 |
| `0x010000..0x10FFFF` | `11110xxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | `10xxxxxx` | 21 | 1mil+ |

</v-click>

<!--
UTF-8 is generally speaking more efficient when dealing with "Latin" based web - Best case 1 byte, worst case, 2 bytes.
UTF-16 is gauranteed to be 2 bytes, if not 4
UTF-32 will always be 4 bytes.

## Let's encode!

1F63B = `0001 1111 0110 0011 1011`

</p>

<div v-click class="mt-30">

<Arrow x1="250" y1="250" x2="170" y2="160" width="5"/>

We need at least 17 bits of room to encode U+1F63B

</div>

<div v-click>

<hr />

`17 > 7` ‚à¥ Needs more than 1 byte

`17 > 11` ‚à¥ Needs more than 2 bytes

`17 > 16` ‚à¥ Needs more than 3 bytes

‚à¥ We need 4 bytes!

`1111 0xxx` `10xx xxxx` `10xx xxxx` `10xx xxxx`

## Summary

<v-clicks>

Unicode is a standard. It defeines a dictionary of `codepoints` to their character descriptions

UTF-8 is an Encoding - defined by the Unicode Standard.

Encodings help humans interpret bytes as painted glyphs

UTF-8 is by far the most common standard due to it's memory efficiency (e.g. variable space)
